Assignment: To create a basic video game prototype within pygame by yourself.
pygame and python copyright to their respective owners.

Bugs:
	When a bullet is in the air input must be given for the game to properly update, so just move the mouse around
	Sound files are not playing correctly, at least on windows, all I hear from my audio device is a click when a sound file should be playing

Things Missing:
	Proper visual feed back, I would much like to have you be able to see a counter of time remaining in turn, current gun angle, and when implemented in future amount of force behind the shot
	Since this is a prototype only one kind of weapon current exists
	Sounds aren't properly operational
	scrollable map to enlarge play field and allow more than one tank per person

How To:
	Run runGame.py
	Shoot at each other until the other is destroyed
	You are limited to 30 seconds per turn

Controls:

	Up Arrow tilts cannon up
	Down Arrow tilts cannon down
	Left Arrow moves tank to the left
	Right Arrow moves tank to the right
	T is a debug kill command
	Return fires your cannon
